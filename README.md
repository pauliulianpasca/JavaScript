# JavaScript

Here are some exercises and examples from the QA course, where I learned the basics of programming in JavaScript. This helped me understand how a programming language operates and how to use it later for creating automated tests in Cypress. Additionally, I learned several functionalities, including math operations, comparison exercises, conditions (else/if), basics of arrow functions, and array methods.

**JSExercises** 

Here I practiced the following exercises:

*********************
1. Create a function that takes an array of numbers arr and returns an inverted array.
Example
invertArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 
Result 
[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
*********************
2. Create a function that takes two arguments. Both arguments are integers, a and b. Return true if one of them is 10 or if their sum is 10.
Examples
makesTen(9, 10) ➞ true
makesTen(9, 9) ➞ false
makesTen(1, 9) ➞ true
*********************
3. Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return both the minimum and maximum numbers.
Example
minMax([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ [1, 5]
**********************
4. Create a function that takes an object argument sizes (contains width, length, height keys) and returns the volume of the box.
Examples
volumeOfBox({ width: 2, length: 5, height: 1 }) ➞ 10
volumeOfBox({ width: 4, length: 2, height: 2 }) ➞ 16
volumeOfBox({ width: 2, length: 3, height: 5 }) ➞ 30
